// You are given a string s. You can convert s to a 
// palindrome by adding characters in front of it.
// Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

/*
    Approach :
        in this case we can find the longest palindromic substring and the remaining 
        can be reversed and added into front.
        for example :
                        s = "aacecaaa"  
                    in this the longest palindromic substring is from 0 to 6th index so the remaining 
                    is 'a' (reverse the remaining string) and add it in the front.
        example 2 :  s ="abcd"
                here the longest substring is a itself 
                the remaining substring is "bcd" reverse it and add it in the front .


        general:
            find the longest palindrominc substr starting from 0th index
            reverse it and add it in the begining.
    Algo:
        1.first take string r = s +'#'+reverseof(s) 
        The "#" in the middle is required, since without the #, the 2 strings could mix with each ther, producing wrong answer.
        2.creating the vector v and intialising all the values with 0 and findin the length of the longest palindromic substring  
            mainfunc(v,r) =>
                we will traverse r and find the v[i] == v[j]
                    i++ and v[j] = i ,j++;
                else
                    if(i==0)  j++;
                    else
                        i =v[i-1]
        3.find the remaining substring from ith pos and reverse that and add it to the starting of the s.

    Time complexity : O(N)
    Space complexity : O(N)  
                    where N is the length of string.
